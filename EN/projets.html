                        While <a href="https://skynium.fr"><strong>Skynium</strong></a> was officially launched in 2025, it is a project that has been maturing within me since 2019. 
                        This company was born from a clear mission: to reconcile users with IT and new technologies. 
                        I offer complete repair, maintenance, and personalized assistance services for those who feel lost when facing the digital world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Passionate about IT since my childhood and driven by a deep desire to help others, I founded Skynium to merge these two universes. 
                        My goal is to make technology accessible to everyone. I strive to transform complex technical problems into simple, fast, and effective solutions.

                    <p>
                        The idea of building the Skynium Arena simply comes from my great passion for Eurovision. 
                        This event is a model for me: it brings together artists from all over Europe in a huge venue, 
                        with impressive lighting and visual effects. This is exactly what makes me want to create this Arena: 
                        to be able to create this magic and gather people in one place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also imagined this arena with a very complete video system. I want it to be equipped with numerous cameras 
                        to film and keep a record of every event. The goal is to have fluid movements and multiple viewing angles 
                        for a professional rendering, just like on TV. My ultimate dream is to build the Skynium Arena 
                        for real and to host the Eurovision Song Contest there one day.

                        <a href="https://abovetheskyproductions.skynium.fr"><strong>Above The Sky Productions</strong></a> is the creative branch of Skynium, dedicated to audiovisual content production. 
                        This brand concretizes one of my future ambitions to direct my own fiction (films, series). 
                        It all started in a private setting: by making films for family events, I discovered a real passion for directing and visual storytelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To shift gears, I am now partnering with a student in film school. 
                        By combining our technical and artistic skills, we aim to produce more ambitious works. 
                        To date, Above The Sky Productions already has six productions to its credit, including a two-hour feature film and a cinema screening.
